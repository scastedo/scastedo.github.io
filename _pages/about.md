Hi! I have just completed my Masters in Physics at the **University of Manchester** and this Autumn I will begin a PhD in **statistical physics** under the supervision of [Remi Monasson](http://www.phys.ens.fr/~monasson/) at the **ENS** in Paris.

In our **Upcoming Research**, we will delve into the intricate trade-offs between circuit architecture, speed, accuracy, and energy consumption in computation. By harnessing statistical physics tools, collaborating closely with neurobiologists, and employing artificial neural networks, the project aims to illuminate an often overlooked aspect of computation.  
Through this research, we hope to advance our understanding of the fundamental principles governing computation efficiency and resource adaptation in neural systems.

**Beyond science**, I have a running interest in radical politics, sociology, and political economy. I would like  to better understand complex issues with real-life applications using the skills I have developed in mathematics and computation. Outside my studies, I have contributed to a think tankâ€™s work on deforestation in relation to COP 26, started up an educational charity and I am currently involved in setting up a cooperative housing project in Manchester.
