Hi! I have just completed my Masters in Physics at the **University of Manchester** and this Autumn I will begin a PhD in **statistical physics** under the supervision of [Remi Monasson](http://www.phys.ens.fr/~monasson/) at the **ENS** in Paris.

In my **Upcoming Research**, I will delve into the intricate trade-offs between circuit architecture, speed, accuracy, and energy consumption in computation. By harnessing statistical physics tools, collaborating closely with neurobiologists for data analysis, and employing artificial neural networks training, the project aims to illuminate the often overlooked aspect of computation. Our focus will be on quantifying the energy required for various computational tasks and investigating how resource shortages affect coding in rodents. Moreover, we will endeavor to optimize training procedures for energy consumption using *meta-learning*, a promising and innovative approach in this context. 
Through this research, we hope to advance our understanding of the fundamental principles governing computation efficiency and resource adaptation in neural systems.

**Beyond science**, I have a running interest in radical politics, sociology, and political economy. I would like  to better understand complex issues with real-life applications using the skills I have developed in mathematics and computation. Outside my studies, I have contributed to a think tankâ€™s work on deforestation in relation to COP 26, started up an educational charity and I am currently involved in setting up a cooperative housing project in Manchester.
