I am currently in my first year of a PhD in **Statistical Physics** under the supervision of [Remi Monasson](http://www.phys.ens.fr/~monasson/) at the **ENS** in Paris. Last summer, I graduated with a first-class Master's in Physics from the **University of Manchester**.

In my research, I am exploring the intricate trade-offs between performance and energy consumption in neural networks, both natural and artificial. By harnessing tools from statistical physics, collaborating with neurobiologists, and employing artificial neural networks, we hope to advance the understanding of the fundamental principles governing computation efficiency and resource adaptation in neural systems.

My previous experience includes investigating generalised correlations in disordered systems, particularly Lotka-Volterra ecosystems using dynamical mean field theory under the supervision of [Tobias Galla](https://sites.google.com/view/tobiasgalla/). The results of which are currently in the process of being published ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12751)).
Additionally, I worked on a coupled magneto-mechanical model with Langevin dynamics during an internship at LPTHE in Paris with [Leticia Cugliandolo](https://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~leticia/). This work has been published in [Physical Review B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.134417).

**Beyond science**, I have a running interest in radical politics, sociology, and political economy. I would like  to better understand complex issues with real-life applications using the skills I have in mathematics and computation. I have contributed to a think tankâ€™s work on deforestation in relation to COP 26, started up an educational charity and I am currently involved in setting up a cooperative housing project in Manchester.
