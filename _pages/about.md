Hi! I have just completed my Masters in Physics at the University of Manchester and this Autumn I will begin a PhD in statistical physics under the supervision of Remi Monasson at the ENS in Paris.

My main motivation lies in attempting to better understand complex issues with real-life applications using computation and modelling.

Outside my studies, I have contributed to a think tankâ€™s work on deforestation in relation to COP 26, started up an educational charity and I am currently involved in setting up a cooperative housing project in Manchester.
